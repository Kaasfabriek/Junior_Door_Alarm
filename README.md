Junior door alarm project.

Are you also always annoyed by people not closing the door behind them?
This project fixes that issue with an simple build that will triger an alarm if the door stays open for too long.

Components you need for this project:
- Any arduino (we used an arduino uno)
- 1 Pushbutton (NO)
- 1 Piezo.
- Some kind of read switch (we used an end stop switch but an magnet read switch would work way better.)

You can find the pinout in the arduino code.
